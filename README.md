### Description:

<p>A random Pok√©mon will appear based on generations selected from settings(initially only Gen 1 pok√©mons are selected by default), can you spell them all correctly? You'll have 6 attemps to do that.<p>

### Objective:

Play around with ‚ö°Ô∏è[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)(build tool) and ‚öôÔ∏è[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)(state manager). I was getting a bit rusty with React so why not...

### Tech used:

`React`, `React Router`, `Redux toolkit`, `Typescript`, `Vite`, `Tailwind CSS`

### Pokemon API link:

PS: Might add new features in future provided I am still hooked with this project üôÇ.
